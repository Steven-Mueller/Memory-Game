## This Project was created within 2 days as my **_final project_** for the _JavaScript Basics_ modul from DCI.

- [x] readline-sync package to get user input
- [x] different callback functions for handling arrays and objects
- [x] useful functions to devide the code into specific parts for better readability
- [x] regular expression for checking user input

- [ ] Better mixing algorithm for elements (at the moment there cant be matches within the same row)
